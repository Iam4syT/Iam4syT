Recently, I lost my dear aunt. she was like the grandma i never met.
She was a lookalike of my grandma, and was a model for what a true wife and sister is.
she was a more than a sister to her brothers,she was a mother, always good and respectufl towards them.
the kind of patience and love only a mother can have for a child.
i hope this project immortalises her, as that was one thing i think she was she neevr got to achive.
but she was not the inspritation for this project.
recently also, i lost a great grand aunt, and even thought i knew her and could she my aunt and her my sis sharing a resemblence with her.
i could not place where she fit in the family tree and how i was related to her.
hence, i spoke with my big uncle, who did enlighten me.
and then, i had the thought of all my family memeber scattered around the world
and as the family grows, we need to keep it close.
hence, i decided to create a website, where we can feel close, learn about our origin and immortalise our dead.

with the hope that, even far apart, we remain close.
