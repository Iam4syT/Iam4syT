I wrote every code in the html and after the tedious work.
i must admit it was good to think through how i will like the webpage be displayed
but doing it once did give the staisfaction
but for idea to product
i had to leverage tools such as chatGPT
I use to bee under the impression that outsourcing this task to these tools makes one less of a developer
but in an age of rapid deployment, it is indeed a tool to improve effeicientcy and reduce errors.

i stan with tools such as cloud services, django, github, vs code, bootstarp and chatgpt that helps software development more about creating and less of typing.
